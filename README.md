Cryptod
=======

This is a simple Cryptography library written in D.

Let's start with a practical example:

<pre>
	import cryptod.blockcipher.aes;
	import cryptod.prf.hmac;
	import cryptod.hash.sha1;
	import cryptod.kdf.pbkdf2;
	
	//This constructs an hmac out of a sha1 function.
	alias hmac!(SHA1ub) HMAC_SHA1; 
	
	//This generates a 128-bit key from the password "password" using a 10,000 iteration PBKDF2 function.
	ubyte[] key = PBKDF2(&HMAC_SHA1, "password", [0x78,0x57,0x8E,0x5A,0x5D,0x63,0xCB,0x06], 10000, 16); 
	
	//Creates a new AES context for the generated key.
	AES aes = new AES(key);
	
	//converts a 16 byte input to a ubyte array
	ubyte[] input = cast(ubyte[])"A 16-byte input.";
	
	//Enciphers the input
	ubyte[] enciphered = aes.Cipher(input);
	
	//Deciphers the enciphered output
	ubyte[] deciphered = aes.InvCipher(enciphered);
	
	assert(input == deciphered);
</pre>

Ciphers
-------

Block Ciphers:
 * AES
 * Blowfish
 * Threefish
 * (BROKEN) DES
 
Stream Ciphers:
 * PRNG xor cipher (takes any deterministic prng as input.)
 
Planned:
 * Assymetric Crypto
 * Twofish
 * Serpent
 * Stream Ciphers
 
Hashes
------

Context Hashes:
 * SHA1
 * (BROKEN) Tiger
 
'Fast' Hashes: (these hashes are not suitable for cryptographic purposes.)
 * murmurhash3
 
Planned:
 * SHA2 Family
 * All SHA3 finalists (Skein &al)
 * More fast hashes

Pseudo Random Number Generators
-------------------------------
 * Mersenne Twister
 * BlumBlumShub (Note: the design of the algorithm is suppossed to be slow and is great for heavy-duty crypto)
 * Counter Mode Block Cipher PRNG (takes any block cipher as input.)
 
Key Derivation Functions
------------------------
 * PBKDF1 (might be broken, not sure, but that might be an obscure case of sha1)
 * PBKDF2 (might be broken, not sure, but that might be an obscure case of sha1)
 
More to come.

Benchmarks
----------

Tons of stuff is way too slow right now.
